## üåü **Centralized Workflow**

### üìñ **What is it?**
The simplest Git workflow where everyone works on a single branch (usually `main` or `master`). Similar to traditional centralized version control systems.

### üéØ **Best for:**
- Small teams (2-5 developers)
- Simple projects
- Teams new to Git
- Projects with infrequent releases

### üîÑ **Workflow Steps**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/company/project.git
cd project

# 2. Make changes
echo "New feature" >> feature.txt

# 3. Stage and commit changes
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# 4. Pull latest changes (in case others pushed)
git pull origin main

# 5. Push your changes
git push origin main
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Handling Conflicts**

```bash
# If push is rejected due to conflicts:
git pull origin main

# Resolve conflicts in files, then:
git add <conflicted-files>
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main
```

### ‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Simple to understand
- Easy to set up
- No complex branching

### ‚ùå **Cons:**
- No isolation of features
- Conflicts are common
- Harder to review changes
- Risk of breaking main branch

---

## üåø **Feature Branch Workflow**

### üìñ **What is it?**
Each feature is developed in its own branch, then merged back to main. Provides better isolation and collaboration.

### üéØ **Best for:**
- Small to medium teams
- Projects with regular feature development
- Teams wanting code review process

### üîÑ **Workflow Steps**

```bash
# 1. Start with updated main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# 3. Work on your feature
echo "Login functionality" >> auth.js
git add auth.js
git commit -m "Add login functionality"

# 4. Push feature branch
git push origin feature/user-authentication

# 5. Create pull request (on GitHub/GitLab)
# ... code review process ...

# 6. Merge to main (after approval)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/user-authentication

# 7. Clean up
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
git push origin --delete feature/user-authentication
```

### üé® **Branch Naming Conventions**

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-login
feature/shopping-cart
feat/api-integration

# Bug fixes
bugfix/fix-login-error
fix/payment-gateway-issue

# Hotfixes
hotfix/security-patch
hotfix/critical-bug

# Documentation
docs/api-documentation
docs/readme-update

# Experiments
experiment/new-ui-design
spike/performance-optimization
```

### üîç **Example: Complete Feature Development**

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/shopping-cart

# Develop feature (multiple commits)
echo "Add to cart functionality" >> cart.js
git add cart.js
git commit -m "Add basic cart structure"

echo "Remove from cart functionality" >> cart.js
git add cart.js
git commit -m "Add remove from cart feature"

echo "Cart total calculation" >> cart.js
git add cart.js
git commit -m "Implement cart total calculation"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/shopping-cart

# After code review and approval, merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff feature/shopping-cart
git push origin main

# Cleanup
git branch -d feature/shopping-cart
git push origin --delete feature/shopping-cart
```

### ‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Feature isolation
- Code review process
- Parallel development
- Clean main branch

### ‚ùå **Cons:**
- More complex than centralized
- Requires discipline
- Need merge strategy

## üîÄ **Gitflow Workflow**

### üìñ **What is it?**
A robust workflow with specific branch types for different purposes. Originally designed by Vincent Driessen.

### üå≥ **Branch Types**

| Branch Type | Purpose | Naming | Merges To |
|-------------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **main** | Production-ready code | `main` | - |
| **develop** | Integration branch | `develop` | `main` |
| **feature** | New features | `feature/feature-name` | `develop` |
| **release** | Prepare releases | `release/1.2.0` | `main` & `develop` |
| **hotfix** | Critical fixes | `hotfix/1.2.1` | `main` & `develop` |

### üéØ **Best for:**
- Large teams
- Scheduled releases
- Multiple environments
- Enterprise projects

### üîÑ **Workflow Steps**

#### üöÄ **Starting a Feature**
```bash
# Start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/payment-integration

# Work on feature
echo "Payment gateway integration" >> payment.js
git add payment.js
git commit -m "Implement payment gateway"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/payment-integration

# Finish feature (merge to develop)
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge --no-ff feature/payment-integration
git push origin develop

# Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/payment-integration
git push origin --delete feature/payment-integration
```

#### üéâ **Creating a Release**
```bash
# Start release from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/1.2.0

# Prepare release (version updates, documentation)
echo "Version 1.2.0" > VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.0"

# Push release branch
git push origin release/1.2.0

# Finish release
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff release/1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge --no-ff release/1.2.0
git push origin develop

# Delete release branch
git branch -d release/1.2.0
git push origin --delete release/1.2.0
```

#### üö® **Creating a Hotfix**
```bash
# Start hotfix from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/1.2.1

# Fix the issue
echo "Critical bug fix" >> security.js
git add security.js
git commit -m "Fix critical security vulnerability"

# Push hotfix
git push origin hotfix/1.2.1

# Finish hotfix
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.2.1
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix version 1.2.1"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.2.1
git push origin develop

# Delete hotfix branch
git branch -d hotfix/1.2.1
git push origin --delete hotfix/1.2.1
```

### üõ†Ô∏è **Gitflow Tools**

```bash
# Install git-flow extension
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install git-flow

# macOS
brew install git-flow

# Initialize gitflow in repository
git flow init

# Start a feature
git flow feature start payment-integration

# Finish a feature
git flow feature finish payment-integration

# Start a release
git flow release start 1.2.0

# Finish a release
git flow release finish 1.2.0

# Start a hotfix

Each developer has their own server-side repository. Great for open-source projects and distributed teams.

### üéØ **Best for:**
- Open-source projects
- Large distributed teams
- External contributors
- Security-conscious organizations

### üîÑ **Workflow Steps**

```bash
# 1. Fork repository on GitHub (creates your copy)

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/project.git
cd project

# 3. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/project.git

# 4. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-functionality

# 5. Make changes and commit
echo "New functionality" >> feature.js
git add feature.js
git commit -m "Add new functionality"

# 6. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/new-functionality

# 7. Create pull request from your fork to upstream

# 8. Keep your fork updated
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

### üîÑ **Maintaining Fork Sync**

```bash
# Regular sync routine
#!/bin/bash
# sync-fork.sh

# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push to your fork
git push origin main

# Clean up merged branches
git branch --merged | grep -v "\*" | grep -v "main" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
```

### üéØ **Contributing to Open Source**

```bash
# 1. Find issue to work on
# 2. Fork repository
# 3. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/open-source-project.git

# 4. Create issue branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-123-memory-leak

# 5. Work on fix
echo "Memory leak fix" >> memory-manager.js
git add memory-manager.js
git commit -m "Fix memory leak in user session management

- Properly dispose of user session objects
- Add cleanup routine for expired sessions
- Update tests to verify fix

Fixes #123"

# 6. Push and create PR
git push origin fix/issue-123-memory-leak
# Create pull request on GitHub
```

### ‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Complete isolation
- Secure (no direct push access)
- Great for open source
- Scales to any team size

### ‚ùå **Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Multiple repositories to manage
- Requires more Git knowledge

```

---

## üîÑ **Merge Strategies**

### üöÄ **Fast-Forward Merge**

```bash
# When possible, Git will fast-forward
git checkout main
git merge feature/simple-change

# Result: Linear history
# main:    A---B---C---D
#                      ‚Üë
#               (feature merged here)
```

### üîÄ **Three-Way Merge**

```bash
# When branches have diverged
git checkout main
git merge feature/complex-feature

# Result: Merge commit created
# main:    A---B-------E (merge commit)
#               \     /
# feature:       C---D
```

### üéØ **No Fast-Forward Merge**

```bash
# Always create merge commit for traceability
git merge --no-ff feature/user-authentication

# Result: Always creates merge commit
# main:    A---B-------C (merge commit)
#               \     /
# feature:       D---E

# Good for feature branch workflow
```

### ‚ö° **Squash Merge**

```bash
# Combine all commits into one
git merge --squash feature/multiple-commits
git commit -m "Add user authentication feature

- Implement login/logout
- Add password validation  
- Create session management
- Add authentication middleware"

# Result: Clean linear history
# main:    A---B---C (single commit with all changes)
```

### üîÑ **Rebase and Merge**

```bash
# Rebase feature branch first
git checkout feature/clean-history
git rebase main

# Then fast-forward merge
git checkout main
git merge feature/clean-history

# Result: Linear history without merge commits
# main:    A---B---C---D---E
#                  (feature commits rebased)
```

### üé® **Interactive Rebase**

```bash
# Clean up commits before merging
git checkout feature/messy-commits
git rebase -i HEAD~4

# Interactive editor opens:
pick 1a2b3c4 Add login form
squash 5d6e7f8 Fix typo in login
squash 9g0h1i2 Another small fix
reword 3j4k5l6 Complete login functionality

# Results in clean, meaningful commits
```

---

## üí° **Best Practices**

### ‚úÖ **Do's**

#### üìù **Commit Messages**
```bash
# Good commit message format
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system

- Implement JWT token-based authentication
- Add login and logout endpoints
- Create user session middleware
- Add password hashing with bcrypt

Closes #123
Reviewed-by: @teammate"

# Follow conventional commits
feat: new feature
fix: bug fix
docs: documentation
style: formatting
refactor: code restructuring
test: adding tests
chore: maintenance
```

#### üåø **Branch Management**
```bash
# Keep branches focused and short-lived
git checkout -b feature/single-focused-task

# Regularly sync with main branch
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase main  # or git merge main

# Use descriptive branch names
git checkout -b feature/user-profile-editing
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-checkout-calculation
```

#### üîÑ **Workflow Discipline**
```bash
# Always pull before starting new work
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-work

# Test before committing
npm test && git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Review your changes before pushing
git diff HEAD~1
git log --oneline -5
```

### ‚ùå **Don'ts**

#### üö´ **Anti-Patterns**
```bash
# Don't commit directly to main (in team environment)
# git checkout main
# git commit -m "Quick fix" ‚ùå

# Don't use vague commit messages
# git commit -m "fix stuff" ‚ùå
# git commit -m "updates" ‚ùå

# Don't keep long-running branches
# feature/big-rewrite (6 months old) ‚ùå

# Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit
# git add login.js payment.js database.js
# git commit -m "Various changes" ‚ùå
```

#### üîß **Recovery Commands**
```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo and discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Fix commit message
git commit --amend -m "Correct message"

# Recover deleted branch
git reflog
git checkout -b recovered-branch <commit-hash>

# Undo merge
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # If merge wasn't pushed yet
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>  # If merge was pushed
```

## üéì **Workflow Templates**

### üåü **Feature Development Template**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# start-feature.sh
FEATURE_NAME=$1

if [ -z "$FEATURE_NAME" ]; then
  echo "Usage: ./start-feature.sh <feature-name>"
  exit 1
fi

# Ensure we're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and checkout feature branch
git checkout -b "feature/$FEATURE_NAME"

echo "Started feature branch: feature/$FEATURE_NAME"
echo "When finished, run: ./finish-feature.sh $FEATURE_NAME"
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# finish-feature.sh
FEATURE_NAME=$1

if [ -z "$FEATURE_NAME" ]; then
  echo "Usage: ./finish-feature.sh <feature-name>"
  exit 1
fi

BRANCH_NAME="feature/$FEATURE_NAME"

# Ensure feature branch is current
git checkout "$BRANCH_NAME"
git push origin "$BRANCH_NAME"

echo "Feature branch $BRANCH_NAME pushed to remote"
echo "Create a pull request at: https://github.com/your-repo/compare/$BRANCH_NAME"
```

### üöÄ **Release Template**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# create-release.sh
VERSION=$1

if [ -z "$VERSION" ]; then
  echo "Usage: ./create-release.sh <version>"
  exit 1
fi

# Start from develop branch (Gitflow)
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create release branch
git checkout -b "release/$VERSION"

# Update version in files
echo "$VERSION" > VERSION
sed -i "s/\"version\": \".*\"/\"version\": \"$VERSION\"/" package.json

# Commit version bump
git add VERSION package.json
git commit -m "Bump version to $VERSION"
