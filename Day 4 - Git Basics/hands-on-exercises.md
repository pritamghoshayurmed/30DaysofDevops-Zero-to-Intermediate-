## 🌱 **Basic Git Operations**

### 🔶 **Exercise 1: Creating Your First Repository**

**Objective**: Create a local Git repository and make your first commit.

**Steps:**

1. Create a new directory for your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-first-repo
   cd my-first-repo
   ```

2. Initialize the directory as a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. Create a README file:
   ```bash
   echo "# My First Git Repository" > README.md
   ```

4. Check the status of your repository:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

5. Add the README file to the staging area:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   ```

6. Make your first commit:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README file"
   ```

7. Check the commit history:
   ```bash
   git log
   ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md

$ git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README file"
[main (root-commit) abcd123] Initial commit: Add README file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md

$ git log
commit abcd123... (HEAD -> main)
Author: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 19 2023 ...

    Initial commit: Add README file
```

**Verification**: You should see your newly created README.md file listed in the commit history.

---

### 🔶 **Exercise 2: Tracking Changes**

**Objective**: Make changes to a file and track them in Git.

**Steps:**

1. Edit the README.md file to add more content:
   ```bash
   echo "Learning Git basics through hands-on exercises" >> README.md
   ```

2. Check what changes you've made:
   ```bash
   git diff
   ```

3. Stage the changes:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   ```

4. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Update README with description"
   ```

5. Create a new file:
   ```bash
   echo "console.log('Hello Git');" > script.js
   ```

6. Stage and commit the new file:
   ```bash
   git add script.js
   git commit -m "Add JavaScript hello script"
   ```

7. View the commit history:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 9a... b/README.md
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 # My First Git Repository
+Learning Git basics through hands-on exercises

$ git log --oneline
789def Add JavaScript hello script
456abc Update README with description
123abc Initial commit: Add README file
```

**Verification**: Your log should show three commits: the initial commit, the README update, and the new script file.

---

### 🔶 **Exercise 3: Working with .gitignore**

**Objective**: Learn how to ignore files from being tracked by Git.

**Steps:**

1. Create some files that should be ignored:
   ```bash
   mkdir logs
   echo "debug info" > logs/debug.log
   echo "error info" > logs/error.log
   touch .env
   echo "DB_PASSWORD=secret" > .env
   ```

2. Check the status (all files should show as untracked):
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. Create a `.gitignore` file:
   ```bash
   echo "# Logs" > .gitignore
   echo "logs/" >> .gitignore
   echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
   echo "# Environment variables" >> .gitignore
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

4. Check the status again:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

5. Add and commit the `.gitignore` file:
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Add gitignore file"
   ```

6. Create a new file that should be tracked:
   ```bash
   echo "This file should be tracked" > tracked.txt
   ```

7. Try to add everything:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git status
   ```

8. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add tracked file"
   ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   .gitignore

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        tracked.txt

$ git add .
$ git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   .gitignore
        new file:   tracked.txt
```

**Verification**: The log and error files should not appear in your `git status` output, but the `tracked.txt` file should be tracked.

---

## 🌿 **Branching & Merging**

### 🔶 **Exercise 4: Creating and Switching Branches**

**Objective**: Learn how to create, switch between, and manage branches.

**Steps:**

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git branch feature-readme-enhancements
   ```

2. List all branches:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

3. Switch to the new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-readme-enhancements
   # Alternatively: git switch feature-readme-enhancements
   ```

4. Make some changes in the new branch:
   ```bash
   echo "## Features" >> README.md
   echo "* Easy version control" >> README.md
   echo "* Collaboration friendly" >> README.md
   ```

5. Commit these changes:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add features section to README"
   ```

6. Switch back to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   # Alternatively: git switch main
   ```

7. Check that the README file doesn't have the changes (the changes are only in the feature branch):
   ```bash
   cat README.md
   ```

8. Create and switch to another branch in one command:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b bugfix-js-error
   # Alternatively: git switch -c bugfix-js-error
   ```

9. Make a change in this branch:
   ```bash
   echo "// Fix for issue #123" >> script.js
   ```

10. Commit the change:
    ```bash
    git add script.js
    git commit -m "Fix JavaScript error"
    ```

11. List all branches with their last commits:
    ```bash
    git branch -v
    ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git branch
* main
  feature-readme-enhancements

$ git branch -v
  bugfix-js-error      abc123f Fix JavaScript error
  feature-readme-enhancements 456def Add features section to README
* main                 789ghi Add tracked file
```

**Verification**: You should see three branches, with different changes in each branch.

---

### 🔶 **Exercise 5: Merging Branches**

**Objective**: Learn how to merge changes from one branch into another.

**Steps:**

1. Make sure you're on the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Merge the feature branch into main:
   ```bash
   git merge feature-readme-enhancements
   ```

3. Check the README file to confirm the changes are there:
   ```bash
   cat README.md
   ```

4. Now merge the bugfix branch:
   ```bash
   git merge bugfix-js-error
   ```

5. Check the script.js file:
   ```bash
   cat script.js
   ```

6. Check the commit history:
   ```bash
   git log --graph --oneline --all
   ```

7. Delete the merged branches:
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature-readme-enhancements
   git branch -d bugfix-js-error
   ```

8. List branches to confirm deletion:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git merge feature-readme-enhancements
Updating abc123..def456
Fast-forward
 README.md | 3 +++
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)

$ git branch
* main
```

**Verification**: The main branch should now contain all changes from both feature and bugfix branches, and those branches should be deleted.

---

### 🔶 **Exercise 6: Resolving Merge Conflicts**

**Objective**: Learn how to resolve merge conflicts when they occur.

**Steps:**

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b conflicting-feature
   ```

2. Edit the README.md file:
   ```bash
   echo "## Contact" >> README.md
   echo "Email: contact@example.com" >> README.md
   ```

3. Commit the change:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add contact section to README"
   ```

4. Switch to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

5. Edit the same part of the README.md file differently:
   ```bash
   echo "## Support" >> README.md
   echo "For help, email support@example.com" >> README.md
   ```

6. Commit this change:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add support section to README"
   ```

7. Try to merge the conflicting branch:
   ```bash
   git merge conflicting-feature
   ```

8. You should see a conflict. Open the README.md file in your editor and you'll see something like:
   ```
   # My First Git Repository
   Learning Git basics through hands-on exercises
   ## Features
   * Easy version control
   * Collaboration friendly
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   ## Support
   For help, email support@example.com
   =======
   ## Contact
   Email: contact@example.com
   >>>>>>> conflicting-feature
   ```

9. Resolve the conflict by editing the file to keep both sections:
   ```markdown
   # My First Git Repository
   Learning Git basics through hands-on exercises
   ## Features
   * Easy version control
   * Collaboration friendly
   ## Support
   For help, email support@example.com
   ## Contact
   Email: contact@example.com
   ```

10. Add the resolved file:
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    ```

11. Complete the merge:
    ```bash
    git commit
    ```

12. Check the log:
    ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git merge conflicting-feature
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

$ git add README.md
$ git commit
[main abc123] Merge branch 'conflicting-feature'
```

**Verification**: The README.md file should now contain both the Support and Contact sections.

   git log --oneline
   ```

3. View history with branch graph:
   ```bash
   git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
   ```

4. View history for a specific file:
   ```bash
   git log --follow -p -- README.md
   ```

5. View changes made by a specific commit (replace with actual hash):
   ```bash
   git show abc123
   ```

6. See who changed what and when in a file:
   ```bash
   git blame README.md
   ```

7. Compare two commits (replace with actual hashes):
   ```bash
   git diff abc123..def456
   ```

8. See all branches that contain a specific commit:
   ```bash
   git branch --contains abc123
   ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git log --oneline
abc123 Merge branch 'conflicting-feature'
def456 Add support section to README
ghi789 Add contact section to README
...

$ git blame README.md
^abc123 (Your Name 2023-09-19 12:00:00 -0500 1) # My First Git Repository
^def456 (Your Name 2023-09-19 12:05:00 -0500 2) Learning Git basics through hands-on exercises
...
```

**Verification**: You should be able to see the detailed history of your repository, including who made changes, when they were made, and what those changes were.

---

### 🔶 **Exercise 8: Using Git Tags**

**Objective**: Learn how to create and manage tags to mark specific points in your repository.

**Steps:**

1. Create a lightweight tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1
   ```

2. Create an annotated tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 release"
   ```

3. List all tags:
   ```bash
   git tag
   ```

4. Show tag details:
   ```bash
   git show v1.0
   ```

5. Create a tag for an older commit (replace with actual hash):
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.5 abc123 -m "Version 0.5 pre-release"
   ```

6. Delete a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -d v0.5
   ```

7. Check out a specific tag:
   ```bash
   git checkout v1.0
   ```

8. Return to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git tag
v0.1
v1.0

$ git show v1.0

   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add new section to README"
   ```

6. Push the changes:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

7. Simulate changes on the remote (do this on GitHub's web interface):
   - Edit the README.md file on GitHub
   - Add a line: "This line was added directly on GitHub."
   - Commit the change

8. Pull the remote changes:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

9. View the updated file:

### 🔶 **Exercise 10: Collaborating with Branches**

**Objective**: Learn how to use branches for collaboration with remote repositories.

**Steps:**

1. Create a new local branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-advanced
   ```

2. Make changes on this branch:
   ```bash
   echo "## Advanced Features" >> README.md
   echo "* Branching strategies" >> README.md
   echo "* Remote collaboration" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add advanced features section"
   ```

3. Push this branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature-advanced
   ```

4. Switch back to main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

5. Pull any new changes:
   ```bash

$ git push origin --delete feature-advanced
To https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
 - [deleted]         feature-advanced
```

**Verification**: Your changes from the feature branch should be merged into main, and the feature branch should be deleted both locally and remotely.

---

## ⏮️ **Undoing Changes**

### 🔶 **Exercise 11: Reverting Changes**

**Objective**: Learn different ways to undo changes in Git.

**Steps:**

1. Make a change you'll want to undo:
   ```bash
   echo "This line will be undone" >> README.md
   ```

2. Undo the change in the working directory (before staging):
   ```bash
   git checkout -- README.md
   # Alternatively: git restore README.md
   ```

3. Make another change and stage it:
   ```bash
   echo "This staged change will be unstaged" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   ```

4. Unstage the change:
   ```bash
   git reset HEAD README.md
   # Alternatively: git restore --staged README.md
   ```

5. Make and commit a change you'll revert:
   ```bash
   echo "This committed change will be reverted" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add line to be reverted"
   ```

6. Revert the last commit:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   ```

7. Make and commit a change you'll modify:
   ```bash
   echo "This committed change will be amended" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add line to be amended"
   ```

8. Make additional changes:
   ```bash
   echo "Additional content for the amended commit" >> README.md
   ```

9. Amend the previous commit:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit --amend -m "Add lines with amendment"
   ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git revert HEAD
[main abc123] Revert "Add line to be reverted"
 1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)

$ git commit --amend -m "Add lines with amendment"
[main def456] Add lines with amendment
 Date: ...
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

**Verification**: Your repository should reflect all the undoing operations, and the commit history should show the revert and amended commits.

---

### 🔶 **Exercise 12: Working with Stashes**

**Objective**: Learn how to temporarily store changes using Git's stash feature.

**Steps:**

1. Make some changes you're not ready to commit:
   ```bash
   echo "Work in progress feature" >> README.md
   echo "console.log('Debug code');" >> script.js
   ```

2. Check status:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. Stash the changes:
   ```bash
   git stash save "WIP: New feature implementation"
   ```

4. Verify working directory is clean:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

5. Make a different change and commit:
   ```bash
   echo "# Project Documentation" > docs.md
   git add docs.md
   git commit -m "Add documentation file"
   ```

6. List stashes:
   ```bash
   git stash list
   ```

7. Apply the stashed changes:
   ```bash
   git stash apply
   ```

8. Check that your changes are back:
   ```bash
   git status
   cat README.md
   cat script.js
   ```

9. Make additional changes:
   ```bash
   echo "Additional WIP feature" >> README.md
   ```

10. Stash these changes:
    ```bash
    git stash save "More WIP features"
    ```

11. Create a new branch and apply the second stash:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b wip-feature
    git stash apply stash@{0}
    ```

12. Commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Implement WIP features"
    ```

13. Clear all stashes:
    ```bash
    git stash clear
    ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git stash save "WIP: New feature implementation"
Saved working directory and index state On main: WIP: New feature implementation

$ git stash list
stash@{0}: On main: More WIP features
stash@{1}: On main: WIP: New feature implementation

$ git stash apply
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md
        modified:   script.js
```

**Verification**: You should be able to stash changes, work on other tasks, then retrieve and apply the stashed changes.

## 🔀 **Git Workflows**

### 🔶 **Exercise 13: Feature Branch Workflow**

**Objective**: Practice a common Git workflow used in team development.

**Steps:**

1. Start from the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/user-login
   ```

3. Implement the feature with multiple commits:
   ```bash
   # Create login form
   mkdir auth
   echo "<form>Login form</form>" > auth/login.html
   git add auth/login.html
   git commit -m "Add login form HTML"

   # Add validation
   echo "function validateLogin() {}" > auth/validation.js
   git add auth/validation.js
   git commit -m "Add login validation"

   # Update README
   echo "## Authentication" >> README.md
   echo "* User login supported" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Document login feature"
   ```

4. Push the feature branch to remote:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/user-login
   ```

5. Simulate a pull request review (in real life, this would be done on GitHub/GitLab):
   ```bash
   # Switch to main to simulate reviewer
   git checkout main

   # Examine changes from the feature branch
   git diff main..feature/user-login

   # Check commit history
   git log feature/user-login --not main --oneline
   ```

6. Merge the feature (approved PR):
   ```bash
   git merge --no-ff feature/user-login -m "Merge feature/user-login"
   ```

7. Push the updated main:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

8. Clean up:
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/user-login
   git push origin --delete feature/user-login
   ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git merge --no-ff feature/user-login -m "Merge feature/user-login"
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 README.md           | 2 ++
 auth/login.html     | 1 +
 auth/validation.js  | 1 +
 3 files changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 auth/login.html
 create mode 100644 auth/validation.js
```

**Verification**: The feature branch should be merged with a merge commit, and all the feature's commits should be visible in the main branch's history.

---

### 🔶 **Exercise 14: Simulating Team Collaboration**

**Objective**: Practice collaboration scenarios with Git.

**Steps:**

1. Simulate a team member working on a feature (create a new branch):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b team/feature-search
   echo "function search() {}" > search.js
   git add search.js
   git commit -m "Implement search functionality"
   git push -u origin team/feature-search
   ```

2. Switch back to your branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

3. Create your own feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/pagination
   echo "function paginate() {}" > pagination.js
   git add pagination.js
   git commit -m "Add pagination functionality"
   ```

4. Simulate team member completing their feature (needs GitHub access):
   ```bash
   # In real-life, team member would push to the shared repository
   git checkout team/feature-search
   echo "function advancedSearch() {}" >> search.js
   git add search.js
   git commit -m "Add advanced search"
   git push
   ```

5. Create a simulated Pull Request and merge it to main (on GitHub)

6. Update your local main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

7. Rebase your feature on the updated main:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/pagination
   git rebase main
   ```

8. Complete your feature:
   ```bash
   echo "const PAGE_SIZE = 10;" >> pagination.js
   git add pagination.js
   git commit -m "Set default page size"
   git push -u origin feature/pagination
   ```

9. Merge your feature to main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/pagination
   git push
   ```

**Verification**: Your main branch should contain both the search and pagination features, with a clean commit history showing when each feature was added.

## 🧠 **Challenge Exercises**

### 🔶 **Exercise 15: Git Hooks and Automation**

**Objective**: Learn how to use Git hooks to automate tasks.

**Steps:**

1. Create a pre-commit hook:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .git/hooks
   touch .git/hooks/pre-commit
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

2. Add content to the pre-commit hook:
   ```bash
   # Add the following content to .git/hooks/pre-commit
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Running pre-commit hook..."
   # Example: Check for trailing whitespace
   if git diff --cached --name-only | xargs grep -l "[[:space:]]$"; then
     echo "Error: Trailing whitespace found in the above files"
     exit 1
   fi
   echo "No trailing whitespace found. Commit allowed."
   exit 0
   ```

3. Try to add a file with trailing whitespace:
   ```bash
   echo "This line has trailing whitespace   " > whitespace-test.txt
   git add whitespace-test.txt
   git commit -m "Test pre-commit hook"
   # This should fail
   ```

4. Fix the file and commit:
   ```bash
   echo "This line has no trailing whitespace" > whitespace-test.txt
   git add whitespace-test.txt
   git commit -m "Fixed whitespace issue"
   # This should succeed
   ```

**Verification**: The hook should prevent commits with trailing whitespace and allow clean commits.

### 🔶 **Exercise 16: Git Submodules**

**Objective**: Learn how to work with Git submodules to include external repositories.

**Steps:**

1. Add a submodule to your repository:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/username/example-library.git lib/example
   ```

2. Check status and commit:
   ```bash
   git status
   git add .gitmodules lib/example
   git commit -m "Add example library as submodule"
   ```

3. Clone a repository with submodules:
   ```bash
   # In a new directory:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git repo-with-submodule
   cd repo-with-submodule
   ```

4. Initialize and update submodules:
   ```bash
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   # Alternative one-liner:
   # git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

5. Update a submodule:
   ```bash
   cd lib/example
   git checkout master
   git pull
   cd ../..
   git add lib/example
   git commit -m "Update example library submodule"
   ```

**Verification**: You should be able to include and manage external repositories as submodules in your project.

### 🔶 **Exercise 17: Git Bisect**

**Objective**: Learn how to use Git's bisect feature to find when a bug was introduced.

**Steps:**

1. Simulate a repository with a bug:
   ```bash
   # Create a new repository for this exercise
   mkdir bisect-exercise
   cd bisect-exercise
   git init
   
   # Add initial working code
   echo "function calculate(x, y) { return x + y; }" > math.js
   git add math.js
   git commit -m "Initial commit: working addition function"
   
   # Make several more commits
   echo "function multiply(x, y) { return x * y; }" >> math.js
   git add math.js
   git commit -m "Add multiplication"
   
   echo "function divide(x, y) { return x / y; }" >> math.js
   git add math.js
   git commit -m "Add division"
   
   # Introduce a bug
   echo "function subtract(x, y) { return x - y + 1; }" >> math.js
   git add math.js
   git commit -m "Add subtraction"
   
   echo "function power(x, y) { return Math.pow(x, y); }" >> math.js
   git add math.js
   git commit -m "Add power function"
   ```

2. Start the bisect process:
   ```bash
   # Start bisect
   git bisect start
   
   # Mark current version as bad
   git bisect bad
   
   # Mark initial commit as good (replace with your initial commit hash)
   git bisect good HEAD~4
   ```

3. Test each version:
   ```bash
   # Git will checkout a middle commit
   # Test the function:
   node -e "const m = require('./math.js'); console.log(m.subtract(10, 5) === 5 ? 'GOOD' : 'BAD');"
   
   # Tell Git the result (good or bad)
   # If result is 'GOOD':
   git bisect good
   # If result is 'BAD':
   git bisect bad
   
   # Continue until Git identifies the bad commit
   ```

4. End the bisect process:
   ```bash
   git bisect reset
   ```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad
$ git bisect good HEAD~4
Bisecting: 2 revisions left to test after this (roughly 1 step)
[commit hash] Add division

$ node -e "const m = require('./math.js'); console.log(m.subtract(10, 5) === 5 ? 'GOOD' : 'BAD');"
BAD

$ git bisect bad
Bisecting: 0 revisions left to test after this (roughly 0 steps)
[commit hash] Add subtraction

$ node -e "const m = require('./math.js'); console.log(m.subtract(10, 5) === 5 ? 'GOOD' : 'BAD');"
BAD

$ git bisect bad
[bad commit hash] Add subtraction
First bad commit: [bad commit hash] Add subtraction
```

**Verification**: Git should identify the commit that introduced the subtraction function as the first bad commit.
