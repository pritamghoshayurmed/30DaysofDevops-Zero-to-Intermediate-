#### **Terraform Best Practices**

```hcl
# Example: Modular Infrastructure with Best Practices
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"
    key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

# Use modules for reusability
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr
  tags = local.common_tags
}

# Implement proper tagging strategy
locals {
  common_tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = var.project_name
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
    Owner       = var.owner
  }
}

# Use data sources for dynamic values
data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {
  state = "available"
}

# Implement resource dependencies explicitly
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  name_prefix = "web-"
  vpc_id      = module.vpc.vpc_id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Use lifecycle rules for resource management
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
    ignore_changes = [
      tags["LastModified"],
    ]
  }

  tags = merge(local.common_tags, {
    Name = "web-server"
    Role = "web"
  })
}
```
