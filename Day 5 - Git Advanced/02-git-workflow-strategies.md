## 🌊 **GitFlow Workflow**

### 🎯 **Overview**

GitFlow is a branching model that provides a robust framework for managing large projects with scheduled releases.

```mermaid
gitGraph:
    commit id: "Initial"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Feature 1"
    branch feature/user-auth
    checkout feature/user-auth
    commit id: "Auth logic"
    commit id: "Tests"
    checkout develop
    merge feature/user-auth
    branch release/1.0
    checkout release/1.0
    commit id: "Bug fixes"
    checkout main
    merge release/1.0
    tag v1.0.0
    checkout develop
    merge release/1.0
```

### 🌿 **Branch Structure**

| Branch | Purpose | Lifetime | Merge Target |
|--------|---------|----------|--------------|
| `main` | Production-ready code | Permanent | Never directly |
| `develop` | Integration branch | Permanent | main (via release) |
| `feature/*` | New features | Temporary | develop |
| `release/*` | Release preparation | Temporary | main + develop |
| `hotfix/*` | Emergency fixes | Temporary | main + develop |

### 🛠️ **GitFlow Commands**

#### **Installation and Setup**

```bash
# Install git-flow (if not available)
# For macOS:
brew install git-flow-avh

# For Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install git-flow

# For Windows:
# Download from: https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh

# Initialize GitFlow in repository
git flow init

# Configuration prompts:
# Branch name for production releases: [main]
# Branch name for "next release" development: [develop]
# Feature branches: feature/
# Bugfix branches: bugfix/
# Release branches: release/
# Hotfix branches: hotfix/
# Support branches: support/
```

#### **Feature Workflow**

```bash
# Start new feature
git flow feature start user-authentication

# Work on feature (creates feature/user-authentication)
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user login"

# Publish feature (push to remote)
git flow feature publish user-authentication

# Pull feature updates
git flow feature pull origin user-authentication

# Finish feature (merge to develop and delete branch)
git flow feature finish user-authentication
```

#### **Release Workflow**

```bash
# Start release branch
git flow release start 1.2.0

# Prepare release (bug fixes, version bumps)
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# Publish release
git flow release publish 1.2.0

# Finish release (merge to main and develop, create tag)
git flow release finish 1.2.0
# This will:
# 1. Merge release/1.2.0 to main
# 2. Tag the merge commit on main
# 3. Merge release/1.2.0 to develop  
# 4. Delete release/1.2.0
```

#### **Hotfix Workflow**

```bash
# Start hotfix from main
git flow hotfix start security-patch

# Fix the issue
# ... make urgent fix ...
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve security vulnerability"

# Finish hotfix (merge to main and develop)
git flow hotfix finish security-patch
# This will create tag automatically
```

### 📋 **GitFlow Best Practices**

#### ✅ **DO:**
- Use for projects with scheduled releases
- Keep feature branches small and focused
- Test thoroughly before finishing features
- Use semantic versioning for releases
- Write clear commit messages

#### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Use for continuous deployment projects
- Keep feature branches alive too long
- Merge directly to main/develop
- Skip release branches for major versions
- Force push shared branches

---

## 🚀 **GitHub Flow**

### 🎯 **Overview**

GitHub Flow is a lightweight workflow perfect for continuous deployment and small teams.

```mermaid
gitGraph:
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "B"
    branch feature
    checkout feature
    commit id: "C"
    commit id: "D"
    checkout main
    merge feature
    commit id: "Deploy"
```

### 🔄 **Workflow Steps**

1. **Create branch** from main
2. **Make changes** and commit
3. **Open Pull Request**
4. **Review and discuss**
5. **Deploy from branch** (optional)
6. **Merge to main**
7. **Deploy from main**

### 🛠️ **Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Create Feature Branch**

```bash
# Always start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and checkout new branch
git checkout -b feature/add-user-dashboard

# Or in one command
git checkout -b feature/add-user-dashboard main
```

#### **Step 2: Work and Commit**

```bash
# Make changes
# ... develop feature ...

# Stage and commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user dashboard layout"

# Continue working
# ... more changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement dashboard API integration"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/add-user-dashboard
```

#### **Step 3: Create Pull Request**

```bash
# Push branch and create PR
git push origin feature/add-user-dashboard

# Using GitHub CLI (gh)
gh pr create --title "Add User Dashboard" --body "Implements user dashboard with real-time data"

# Or create PR via GitHub web interface
```

#### **Step 4: Review Process**

```bash
# Address review feedback
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address PR review comments"
git push origin feature/add-user-dashboard

# Update PR description if needed
gh pr edit --body "Updated implementation based on review feedback"
```

#### **Step 5: Merge and Deploy**

```bash
# After approval, merge via GitHub interface or CLI
gh pr merge --squash

# Clean up local branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/add-user-dashboard
```

### 🎯 **GitHub Flow Best Practices**

#### **Branch Naming Conventions**
```bash
feature/add-payment-processing
bugfix/fix-login-validation
hotfix/security-patch-auth
docs/update-api-documentation
chore/update-dependencies
```

#### **Pull Request Templates**

Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:

```markdown

## 🔄 **GitLab Flow**

### 🎯 **Overview**

GitLab Flow combines the best of GitFlow and GitHub Flow, supporting multiple deployment environments.

### 🌿 **Environment Branches**

```mermaid
gitGraph:
    commit id: "A"
    branch staging
    checkout staging
    commit id: "B"
    branch production
    checkout production
    commit id: "C"
    checkout main
    commit id: "D"
    checkout staging
    merge main
    commit id: "E"
    checkout production
    merge staging
    commit id: "F"
```

### 🏗️ **Environment Strategy**

```bash
# Main development branch
main → staging → production

# Or with multiple environments
main → pre-production → production
main → staging → production
```

### 🛠️ **Implementation**

#### **Development Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Feature development
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/new-api-endpoint

# 2. Develop and test
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new API endpoint"
git push origin feature/new-api-endpoint

# 3. Create merge request to main
# ... review and merge ...

# 4. Deploy to staging
git checkout staging
git merge main
git push origin staging

# 5. Deploy to production (after staging validation)
git checkout production  
git merge staging
git push origin production
```

#### **Release Management**

```bash
# Create release branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b release/2.1.0

# Cherry-pick commits for release
git cherry-pick abc123  # Important feature
git cherry-pick def456  # Critical bug fix

# Merge to production
git checkout production
git merge release/2.1.0
git tag v2.1.0
git push origin production --tags

# Merge back to main
git checkout main
git merge release/2.1.0
```

## ⚡ **Feature Branch Workflow**

### 🎯 **Simple and Effective**

Perfect for small teams and simple projects.

### 🔄 **Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/user-preferences

# 2. Develop feature
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user preferences"

# 3. Keep branch updated
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# 4. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/user-preferences

# 5. Merge after review
# ... merge via PR ...

# 6. Clean up
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/user-preferences
```

---

## 🏢 **Enterprise Workflows**

### 🎯 **Large Scale Development**

For organizations with multiple teams and complex release cycles.

### 🏗️ **Multi-Repository Strategy**

#### **Mono-repo Approach**
```bash
project-monorepo/
├── frontend/
├── backend/
├── mobile/
├── shared/
└── tools/
```

#### **Multi-repo Approach**
```bash
# Separate repositories
user-service.git
payment-service.git
frontend-web.git
frontend-mobile.git
```

### 🔄 **Release Train Model**

```bash
# Monthly release train
main → release/2023.11 → production
      └→ release/2023.12 → staging

# Feature development continues on main
# Cherry-pick critical fixes to release branches
```

### 🛠️ **Implementation Example**

```bash
# 1. Feature development (2-week sprints)
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/JIRA-1234-payment-integration

# 2. Development and review
# ... feature complete ...
git rebase main  # Keep history clean
git push origin feature/JIRA-1234-payment-integration

# 3. Merge to main after code review
# ... automated testing passes ...

# 4. Release branch creation (monthly)
git checkout main
git checkout -b release/2023.11

# 5. Cherry-pick features for release
git cherry-pick abc123  # JIRA-1234
git cherry-pick def456  # JIRA-1235

# 6. QA and stabilization
# ... bug fixes on release branch ...

# 7. Production deployment
git checkout production
git merge release/2023.11
git tag v2023.11.0

# 8. Merge fixes back to main
git checkout main
git merge release/2023.11
```
